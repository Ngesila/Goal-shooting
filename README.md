#### click left or righ kick, submit.Goalkeeper jumps to, the right or left represent the randomly generated numbers.The even number are for right and odd for left.A goal is only achieved if the kicker and goalkeeper are opposite, one side is either left or the other is right.If both sides are same, i.e right-right or left-left then that counts as missed score.After 5 goals the game resets.It is simple and fun!
